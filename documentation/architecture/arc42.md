# BrokerX -  Architecture Documentation
This document is based on the arc42 model and describes the BrokerX platform, an web-based simulated stock broking platform as a term project for LOG430, Fall 2025, Ã‰TS, MontrÃ©al.


## 1. Introduction and Goals
### Requirements overview
The BrokerX application is a web-based  client-server system for simulated stock broking. It is an educational project that aims to replicate in a simulated environment online broking applications such as Wealthsimple. No real money or personal information will be collected, exchanged, and/or used in the making, deployment and/or use of this application.

### Quality goals
Note that quality requirements refer strictly to Phase 1 of the project and will be updated in later phases to reflect the current expectations.

| Priority | Quality goal | Scenario |
|----------|------------------|----------|
| 1 | **Maintenability** | Separation of concerns through the use of the hexagonal architecture |
| 2 | **Persistence** | Support of a backend database with PostgreSQL |
| 3 | **Latency** | P95: Less than 500 ms to place a buy order |
| 4 | **Throughput** | More than 300 buy orders per second |
| 5 | **Availability** | Greater or equal to 90% uptime |


### Stakeholders
- Developer : Learning how to design and implement a system from beginning to end.
- Clients : Exchange financial assets through a web-based interface.
- Professor/Lab assistants : Assess learning progress and competency.

## 2. Architectural Constraints
| Constraint | Description | Justification |
|----------|---------------|---------------|
| **Technologies** | Use of Java, PostgreSQL, Docker| Well documented and lightweight tools |
| **Testing** | JUnit (unit testing), Cypress (E2E) | Reliable testing frameworks that allow full coverage |
| **CI/CD** | Continuous integration and deployment through GitHub Actions | Ease of use, tests and deployment automation |
| **Deployment** | Deployment in Docker containers | Chosen for simplicity and portability |
| **Educational** | Use of a monolithic architecture (Phase 1) | Must conform to course requirements |


## 3. System Scope and Context

### 3.1 Business Context
![Activity Diagram](../images/activity.png)

The system currently allows clients to add funds to their wallets. Additional functionalities (including placing order and seeing their portfolio) will be added during the following phases of the project.
### 3.2 Technical Context
- **Client**: `BrokerX.java`- Web-based java application
- **Database Layer**: PostgreSQL database with DAO pattern.
- **Simulated Payment Service**: JSON file that mocks a banking account for clients to withdraw money.
