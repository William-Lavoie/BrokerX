# ADR 003 â€“ Implementation in Python with the Django Framework

## Status
Accepted

## Context

The application needs a platform to be developped on. After initial brainstorming, two otpions were left, Django or Java with SpringBoot. Considerations were made for performance, level of previous knowledge, ease of use, and more. This is a major decision that will impact the application for the rest of its life cycle, and is something that impacts how the application is conceived, tested, maintained and deployed.

## Decision

The Django framework has been chosen has the basis of this project.

Django is a popular and very well-documented framework, which played a part in this decision. Moreover, it offers various services such as an authentication system, an ORM, a logging system, and more. The convenience of having such features bundled in a single framework made this an attractive option. Furthermore, Django allows easy and traceable database migrations, which factored in the benefits of using it. Additionally, the fact that I am familiar with Django and have no experience with SpringBoot had a role in this decision.

## Consequences

The choice of framework will impact how the application is designed. The main drawback of Django is its inferior performances when compared to Java, however I believe that with smart caching and other techniques, the quality requirements for the project will be able to be met and even exceeded with Django.
