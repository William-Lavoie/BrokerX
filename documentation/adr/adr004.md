# ADR 004 â€“ Secure authentication for REST API

## Status
Accepted

## Context

Security is a priority for BrokerX since client information is a sensitive matter. As much, there needs to be a robust and modern authentification system to serve the API. Several ressources were considered, including KeyCloak, Logto and Casdoor. The features required, beyond secure and reliable authentication which every platform provided, are login through email, MFA, login through external sources (Github, Facebook, etc), prevention of brute-forcing, and a highly customizable UI. It also needs to be easily deployable in a Docker.

## Decision

KeyCloack has been chosen as the security provider for BrokerX.

It offers all the above features and has straightforward documentation. However, this decision comes with potential issues, such as the high maintenance required by frequent updates and a steeper learning curve as opposed to other solutions. Since this is an educational project limited in time, and that KeyCloak fulfills all my requirements, I believe it is nonetheless the best option.

## Consequences

The security layer between the frontend and the REST API will be served by KeyCloak.
